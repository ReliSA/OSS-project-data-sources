[KIV/OPSWI] Analysis of open source portals from the perspective of project data
=================================================================

## Task ##
The goal of the project is to help research process data in open source projects.

* [1] ⏳ To propose a basic classification of OSS projects for the analysis of their data
* [[2]](Code hosting platforms) ⏳ Find, explore and describe OSS portals (github, apache, gitlab, sourceforge, ...) -- for each: whether/what is its focus, used version control system and issue tracking system, possibilities of obtaining data from them
* [3] ⏳ Find out what tools for analyzing such portals already exist
* [4] ⏳ Write a [single-purpose] tool that provides an interface for selecting projects from OSS portals to search for subsets of a large volume of projects suitable for further investigation
