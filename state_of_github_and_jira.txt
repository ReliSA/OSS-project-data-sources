GITHUB

This is a version of the class as similar as possible to the gtilab.py class to maintain program consistency.
Several functionalities are handled differently, of course, since github and gitlab api are not identical.
However, understanding the functionality of one class should be sufficient to understand the other class as well.
The output is as close as possible to the GitLab output.

Example of github.py output:
github,169606323,instantpage,instant.page,2019-02-07T16:49:59Z,2023-01-30T12:27:20Z,https://github.com/instantpage/instant.page,https://api.github.com/repos/instantpage/instant.page,MIT License,102,108,89,20,69,,198,

JIRA

This program is capable of extracting project-related data from the Apache Jira Project Management Tool via its API (https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/project). 

The program is mainly focused on:

	• Fetching a list of projects from the Jira API.
	• Parsing the project data from JSON format into dictionaries.
	• Providing support for pagination by storing and following links from API responses.
	• Handling response status codes to ensure successful data retrieval.
	• Making HTTP GET requests to obtain JSON data.
	• Limiting the number of projects fetched according to the configuration.
	• Pausing between requests to avoid overwhelming the API.
	• Retrieving the number of components for a specific project.
	• Providing the option to use mock data for testing purposes.

Care has been taken to be consistent with the github and gitlab classes. However, Jira (the Jira API options) differs from these tools in several ways.

Error handling for network issues or unexpected API responses could be added/improved.
Some parts of the code can be used as placeholders for future functionality.

CONFIG.INI has been modified with new features.
